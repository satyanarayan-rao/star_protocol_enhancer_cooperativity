# Description of sites

## Figure 5A

All MNase peaks found at enhancers are considered in this analysis. 
Two lines in the plot correspond to reads mapped to mnase peaks in open and closed enhancers. The bed files with mnase peak loci are:

- `mnase_peaks_open_enh.bed`
- `mnase_peaks_closed_enh.bed`

Please see `figure5a/reproduce_sites.sh` for details. 


## Figure 5C,D

Example is shown for `peak_229`. Please see `example.bed` in this directory. 

## Figure 5F

MNase peaks used in this analysis have at least 15 dSMF reads mapped to each
peak. The bed file with MNase peak loci is:

- `mnase_peaks_in_open_and_closed_enhancers.bed`
